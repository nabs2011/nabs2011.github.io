Welcome to the third project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

## Getting Started

In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in *monetary units*) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). For the purposes of this project, the features `'Channel'` and `'Region'` will be excluded in the analysis — with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.

Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the wholesale customers dataset
try:
    data = pd.read_csv("customers.csv")
    data.drop(['Region', 'Channel'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    print("Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.".format(*data.shape))
except:
    print("Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?")
```

    Wholesale customers dataset has 440 samples with 6 features each.


## Data Exploration
In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.

Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: **'Fresh'**, **'Milk'**, **'Grocery'**, **'Frozen'**, **'Detergents_Paper'**, and **'Delicatessen'**. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.


```python
# Display a description of the dataset
display(data.describe())
```

### Implementation: Selecting Samples
To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add **three** indices of your choice to the `indices` list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.


```python
# TODO: Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset
indices = [4,60,98]

# Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples
samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
print("Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:")
display(samples)
```

    Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:

### Question 1
Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.  

* What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?

**Hint:** Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, delis, wholesale retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying *"McDonalds"* when describing a sample customer as a restaurant. You can use the mean values for reference to compare your samples with. The mean values are as follows:

* Fresh: 12000.2977
* Milk: 5796.2
* Grocery: 7951.3
* Frozen: 3071.93
* Detergents_paper: 2881.4
* Delicatessen: 1524.8

Knowing this, how do your samples compare? Does that help in driving your insight into what kind of establishments they might be? 


**Answer:**
Overall, the standard deviation (SD) for each product category is higher than the mean which may be an indication of the data not following a normal distribution. Additionally this may also highlight the disaparate range of data avaialble within this dataset. 

**Sample Row 0:** 
* Detergents_paper is below the mean yet within one SD. Fresh and Delicatessen are significantly higher than the mean while all other product categories are approx. at mean. This indicates that this particular buyer could be a store which focuses on fresh food and deli products i.e. a Deli.

**Sample Row 1:**
* Deli and Frozen items are well below the mean while the Fresh and Milk are below mean by a small amount and all other categories are well above the mean. This may be indicative of a local corner-store with high shelf items. 

**Sample Row 2:**
* All product categories here are well below the mean, this may be a small service station which has a small selection of basic items. 


```python
# calculating percentiles of purchases 
from scipy import stats

samples_pct = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices],columns = data.columns).reset_index(drop=True)

for col in samples_pct.columns:
    samples_pct[col] = samples_pct[col].apply(lambda x:stats.percentileofscore(data[col], x))

### Implementation: Feature Relevance
One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.
 - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.
 - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.
 - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function.


```python
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn import model_selection
```


```python
# TODO: Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature
new_data = data.drop('Fresh',axis=1)

X = new_data.copy()
y = data.Fresh

# TODO: Split the data into training and testing sets(0.25) using the given feature as the target
# Set a random state.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = model_selection.train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 92)


# TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
regressor = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=92)

regressor.fit(X_train,y_train)

# TODO: Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
score = regressor.score(X_test,y_test)

print('The model has a R^2 of {:.3f}'.format(score))
```

    The model has a R^2 of -0.052



```python
# creating a loop to understand which column has the highest R^2 score:

for col in data.columns:
    new_data = data.drop(col,axis=1)
    X = new_data.copy()
    y = data[col]
    # TODO: Split the data into training and testing sets(0.25) using the given feature as the target
    # Set a random state.
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = model_selection.train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 92)


    # TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
    regressor = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=92)

    regressor.fit(X_train,y_train)

    # TODO: Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
    score = regressor.score(X_test,y_test)
    
    col_name = str(col)
    print('The model trained for ' + col_name + ' has a R^2 of {:.3f}'.format(score))
    
    
```

    The model trained for Fresh has a R^2 of -0.052
    The model trained for Milk has a R^2 of 0.139
    The model trained for Grocery has a R^2 of 0.197
    The model trained for Frozen has a R^2 of -3.329
    The model trained for Detergents_Paper has a R^2 of 0.721
    The model trained for Delicatessen has a R^2 of -0.095


### Question 2

* Which feature did you attempt to predict? 
* What was the reported prediction score? 
* Is this feature necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?

**Hint:** The coefficient of determination, `R^2`, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative `R^2` implies the model fails to fit the data. If you get a low score for a particular feature, that lends us to beleive that that feature point is hard to predict using the other features, thereby making it an important feature to consider when considering relevance.

**Answer:**
I created a loop to run through all 6 columns, given the small number of features this was computationally feasible.
Detergents_Paper had the highest $R^2$ score of 0.721 which means that this category has a high correlation against the other features and may in itself be redundant in helping create customer segments. 

### Visualize Feature Distributions
To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.


```python
# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
pd.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```

    /Users/nabeel/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:2: FutureWarning: pandas.scatter_matrix is deprecated. Use pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix instead
      


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/customer_segments_18_1.png)



### Question 3
* Using the scatter matrix as a reference, discuss the distribution of the dataset, specifically talk about the normality, outliers, large number of data points near 0 among others. If you need to sepearate out some of the plots individually to further accentuate your point, you may do so as well.
* Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? 
* Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? 
* How is the data for those features distributed?

**Hint:** Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? You can use [corr()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) to get the feature correlations and then visualize them using a [heatmap](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html)(the data that would be fed into the heatmap would be the correlation values, for eg: `data.corr()`) to gain further insight.


```python
import seaborn as sns
```

**Answer:**

**Distribution of the data:**
The data is right skewed with long tails, specifically there is heavy distribution between 0-20,000 m.u. and then it tapers off at defering rates for each of the categories. There looks be a large number of outliers in the data presumably due to the range of customers involved within the data set (larger customer will naturally buy more) therefore this doesn't seem to be outliers from an anomaly standpoint but rather relating to a specific group of customers. 
**ASKUDACITY** IS that point correct? How do you treat outliers in that situation?

The heatmap below highlights that there is very clear correlations (pink squares) between product categories, specifically between Milk & Grocery, Milk & Detergents_Paper & Grocery & Detergents. This confirms the above asertion that there is a correlation between the categories which can be used to predict the spend within categories. 


```python
sns.heatmap(data.corr(),cmap='cool')
```

## Data Preprocessing
In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

### Implementation: Feature Scaling
If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling — particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying logarithmic scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.
 - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying logarithmic scaling. Again, use `np.log`.


```python
# TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
log_samples = np.log(samples)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
pd.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```

    /Users/nabeel/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:8: FutureWarning: pandas.scatter_matrix is deprecated. Use pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix instead
      


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/customer_segments_25_1.png)



### Observation
After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).

Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.


```python
# Display the log-transformed sample data
display(log_samples)
```

### Implementation: Outlier Detection
Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.
 - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.
 - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.
 - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.

**NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  
Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`.


```python
# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values

### Question 4
* Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above? 
* Should these data points be removed from the dataset? 
* If any data points were added to the `outliers` list to be removed, explain why.

** Hint: ** If you have datapoints that are outliers in multiple categories think about why that may be and if they warrant removal. Also note how k-means is affected by outliers and whether or not this plays a factor in your analysis of whether or not to remove them.

**Answer:**
PCA measures the correlation between features and therefore if there are outliers which appear across features, these need to be removed to ensure that this doesn't impact the calculation of PCA. When running the code block below, I identified that these indices do appear across multiple product categories: [65, 66, 128, 154, 75]


```python
# find indices of data points considered outliers for more than one features
from collections import Counter
outliers_multiple = [k for k, v in Counter(indices).items() if v > 1]
outliers_multiple
```




    [65, 66, 128, 154, 75]



## Feature Transformation
In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.

### Implementation: PCA

Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the `good_data` to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension — how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
```


```python
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
pca = PCA(n_components = 6)
pca.fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)
# ASK UDACITY - why do we have to PCA transform log samples? We don't use that in this code block??

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = vs.pca_results(good_data, pca)
```

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/customer_segments_36_0.png)



### Question 5

* How much variance in the data is explained* **in total** *by the first and second principal component? 
* How much variance in the data is explained by the first four principal components? 
* Using the visualization provided above, talk about each dimension and the cumulative variance explained by each, stressing upon which features are well represented by each dimension(both in terms of positive and negative variance explained). Discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.

**Hint:** A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an *increase* of the *positive-weighted* features and a *decrease* of the *negative-weighted* features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the individual feature weights.

**Answer:**

1) 70.68% of the total variance is explained by the first and second principal component

2) 93.11% is explained by the first four principal components 

3) The top 4 dimensions:

*Dimension 1:* Milk, Grocery and Detergents_Paper make up for the majority of this dimension, representing customers who own groceries. 

*Dimension 2:* This is focused on the inverse of dimension one which makes sense as it focuses on the other variances in the dataset. This dimension focuses on customers who purchase fresh food.

*Dimension 3:* Looks at Deli and Frozen compared to fresh, this means that there are some variances between Deli and Frozen purchases compared with Fresh purchases.

*Dimension 4:* The fourth dimension places highest weights on 'Frozen' (positive weight) and 'Delicatessen' (negative weight). It best represents the difference in customer spendings between frozen food and deli.


```python
print(pca_results['Explained Variance'].cumsum())
```

    Dimension 1    0.4430
    Dimension 2    0.7068
    Dimension 3    0.8299
    Dimension 4    0.9311
    Dimension 5    0.9796
    Dimension 6    1.0000
    Name: Explained Variance, dtype: float64


### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.

# Display sample log-data after having a PCA transformation applied
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))

### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data — in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `reduced_data`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with only two dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2)

# TODO: Transform the good data using the PCA fit above
reduced_data = pca.fit(good_data).transform(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])
```

### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.


```python
# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))
```

## Visualizing a Biplot
A biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal components (in this case `Dimension 1` and `Dimension 2`). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of the original features along the components. A biplot can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.

Run the code cell below to produce a biplot of the reduced-dimension data.


```python
# Create a biplot
vs.biplot(good_data, reduced_data, pca)
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a213b04a8>



![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/customer_segments_47_1.png)



### Observation

Once we have the original feature projections (in red), it is easier to interpret the relative position of each data point in the scatterplot. For instance, a point the lower right corner of the figure will likely correspond to a customer that spends a lot on `'Milk'`, `'Grocery'` and `'Detergents_Paper'`, but not so much on the other product categories. 

From the biplot, which of the original features are most strongly correlated with the first component? What about those that are associated with the second component? Do these observations agree with the pca_results plot you obtained earlier?

## Clustering

In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale. 

### Question 6

* What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? 
* What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? 
* Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?

** Hint: ** Think about the differences between hard clustering and soft clustering and which would be appropriate for our dataset.

**Answer:**
K-Means: Is a simplier, lesss computationally intensive model which will separate all data points into distinct clusters (hard clustering). 
GMM: Is a soft clustering model which is more computationally intensive but it provides a great degree of flexibility in identifying artibarily complex distributions. It also does not require initial assignment of points for the model to run. 

**I will use GMM for this example** as the dataset is small so ther shouldn't be too much computational strain and the data also seems to have unique, unequal groups which will require the model to have more flexibility in producing an outcome.

### Implementation: Creating Clusters
Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data — if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.
 - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.
 - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.
 - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.
 - Import `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.
   - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result.


```python
# temporary as sklearn GMM has been depreciated
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning) 
```


```python
from sklearn.mixture import GMM
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
```


```python
# TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
clusterer = GMM(n_components=2,random_state=92)
clusterer.fit(reduced_data)    
# TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

# TODO: Find the cluster centers
centers = clusterer.means_

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

# TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
score = silhouette_score(reduced_data,preds,metric='mahalanobis')

print("The mean silhouette coefficient for 2 clusters is {}".format(round(score, 4)))
```

    The mean silhouette coefficient for 2 clusters is 0.3671


### Question 7

* Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. 
* Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?


```python
for n in range(2,10):
    # TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
    clusterer = GMM(n_components=n,random_state=92)
    clusterer.fit(reduced_data)    
    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
    preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

    # TODO: Find the cluster centers
    centers = clusterer.means_

    # TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
    sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

    # TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
    score = silhouette_score(reduced_data,preds,metric='mahalanobis')

    print("The mean silhouette coefficient for " +str(n)+" clusters is {}".format(round(score, 4)))
```

    The mean silhouette coefficient for 2 clusters is 0.3671
    The mean silhouette coefficient for 3 clusters is 0.342
    The mean silhouette coefficient for 4 clusters is 0.3097
    The mean silhouette coefficient for 5 clusters is 0.2923
    The mean silhouette coefficient for 6 clusters is 0.2518
    The mean silhouette coefficient for 7 clusters is 0.3103
    The mean silhouette coefficient for 8 clusters is 0.2984
    The mean silhouette coefficient for 9 clusters is 0.2683


**Answer:**
The GMM model had the highest silhouette score for 2 clusters

### Cluster Visualization
Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters. 


```python
# Display the results of the clustering from implementation
vs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)
```

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/customer_segments_60_0.png)



### Implementation: Data Recovery
Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Apply the inverse transform to `centers` using `pca.inverse_transform` and assign the new centers to `log_centers`.
 - Apply the inverse function of `np.log` to `log_centers` using `np.exp` and assign the true centers to `true_centers`.



```python
# TODO: Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
display(true_centers)

### Question 8

* Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project(specifically looking at the mean values for the various feature points). What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?

**Hint:** A customer who is assigned to `'Cluster X'` should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of `'Segment X'`. Think about what each segment represents in terms their values for the feature points chosen. Reference these values with the mean values to get some perspective into what kind of establishment they represent.

**Answer:**
ASK UDACITY: Personally I don't think that 2 clusters are representative of the entire dataset and i think the model is acting incorrectly because we only fed it the 'reduced_data' which had 2 dimensions from our PCA. I think this shows in the analysis

**Segment 0:** is at ~50 percentile for Fresh and Frozen while being at ~30 for Milk, Grocery & Detergents_Paper. Deli is at ~40. This indicates to me that these customers are purchasing mainly fresh foods as they are a fresh food grocer (fruit shop) where they provide local communities with fresh produce particularly. 

**Segment 1:** Has ~70 percentile for Milk, Grocery and Detergents while ~30 percentile for Frozen and Fresh. Deli is similar to segment at ~50. This being the inverse of Segment 0 makes common sense and I think it's representative of the corner store or larger grocer who provies high shelf life items and stocks items required for everyday use within households.


```python
# calculating percentiles for true_centers segments 
from scipy import stats

samples_pct = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices],columns = data.columns).reset_index(drop=True)

for col in true_centers.columns:
    true_centers[col] = true_centers[col].apply(lambda x:stats.percentileofscore(data[col], x))

true_centers

### Question 9

* For each sample point, which customer segment from* **Question 8** *best represents it? 
* Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*

Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.


```python
# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print("Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred)
```

    Sample point 0 predicted to be in Cluster 1
    Sample point 1 predicted to be in Cluster 1
    Sample point 2 predicted to be in Cluster 0


**Answer:**
I do not think this model represents the samples well. 
Sample 1 has high Fresh,Milk, Frozen, Deli and Grocery while Sample 2 has very low Frozen and Deli but very high Detergents_Paper. Sample 3 is vastly different from sample 1 & 2 which is why I believe the model has separated the samples in this format. Personally, i believe we should be using three clusters for this model.


```python
display(samples)
```

## Conclusion

In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships.

### Question 10
Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. 

* How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*

**Hint:** Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?

**Answer:**
The delivery service will impact customer segments differently and therefore the wholesale distributor must be cautious on how they change these processes. Segment 0 has high fresh purchases which would require more frequent deliveries to ensure stock is available but also that it does not spoil. Additionally, segment 0 also require large quantities of Frozen items, as freezer space will also be limited more frequent but small deliveries will ensure these retailers can appropriately manage their inventory costs. 

On the other hand, Segment 0 has high Detergemts_Paper and Grocery purchases which are traditionally more long shelf life items which can be delivered a little less frequently without issues for freezer storage nor items going bad. I believe Segment 1 is more likely to react positively from this change. 

To conduct the A/B test on this data, it will need to be done with a control and test group both with equal representation of customer segments. After these groups the customer reactions between the control groups and test groups for each segment will need to be analysed to understand customer reactions. 

### Question 11
Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.  
* How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the **customer segment** data?

**Hint:** A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable?

**Answer:** 
The wholesale distributions can build a binary classification model with the existing data to identify if customers are 'segment 0' or 'segment 1'. This supervised learning model can then be applied to the new customers which will help predict their segment by using the estiated product spending provided.

### Visualizing Underlying Distributions

At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.

Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.

### Question 12

* How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? 
* Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? 
* Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?

**Answer:**
The clustering algorithm and number of clusters based on the silhouette coefficient identified 2 clusters in the data, which I was skeptical about. Although when comparing to the underlying channel distribution it is apparent that this was an accurate representation of the data. There are some customers which would be classified purely as Retailers or HoReCa customers. I would consider this classsification to be very consistent with the previous cluster model which segmented the data.
