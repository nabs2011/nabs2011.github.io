# Predicting Titanic Survival with Logistic Regression

## Introduction

In this project, I explored how to use logistic regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The dataset comes from the famous Kaggle Titanic competition, and the goal is to build a model that can classify whether a passenger survived based on features like age, class, and family size.

Throughout this post, I’ll walk you through the data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results. I’ll also explain the reasoning behind each technical decision to help readers of varying backgrounds understand the process.
